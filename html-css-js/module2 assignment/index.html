                <h2 id="one">Eros</h2>
                <p>
                    This types of love closely resembles what western view as romantic love "intimate love " this is the sexual chemistry 
                    and desire eros wasn't necessarily viewed in a positive light(more like lust or infactuation) but many greeks
                    viewed eros as dangerous .

            <section>
                <h2 id="two">philia</h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike eros philia was viewed as an Ideal love in todays terms it wud be as brotherly love or friendship it was about showing 
                    loyalty, giving sacrifice, showing appreciation and more nobel form of love which we might be lacking today.  
                </p>

                <h2 id="three">Agape</h2>
                <p>
                    This is more abstract than other two forms of love and is sometimes reffered to as univesal love or as charity or 
                    even altruism it's love inside of us that we give freely to others - regradless of our relationship to them and don't need 
                    to know or met them to help them while not expecting anything good in return.
